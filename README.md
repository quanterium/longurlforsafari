Long URL for Safari is Safari Extension to automatically translate short URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc.) to reveal and link directly to the target page. You can use a tooltip to reveal details about the target page and automatically replace the link, completely bypassing the URL shortening service.

For more details, see [the wiki](https://github.com/quanterium/longurlforsafari/wiki).
