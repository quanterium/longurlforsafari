#summary List of sites for which the extension will not operate.

= Introduction =

There are some sites on which the extension is designed not to operate.  Prior to version 1.2, the only block list was built into the extension and changes were only included in new releases.

Version 1.2 of the extension added a user-editable block list.  Additional changes in that version resolved many of the performance issues, so those sites were removed from the built-in block list.

If you believe a particular site is encountering performance issues, you can try adding it to the block list in the Preferences window.  If that doesn't resolve your issue, or it does but it does for a site you would like the extension to function, please report it by creating a new Issue in the Issue Tracker.

The following sites are blocked because they were blocked by the original Greasemonkey script or Google Chrome extension, to allow the pages to demonstrate the extension's function:
