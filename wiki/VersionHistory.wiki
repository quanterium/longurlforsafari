*1.5*:
 * Prevent memory leak, see http://ajaxian.com/archives/dynamic-script-generation-and-memory-leaks

*1.4*:
 * optimize showTooltip function -> 10x faster with ff \o/ (mouse over -> tooltip time to appear)
 * remove processRequest & showTooltip useless parameter (json), using LongURL.storedRequests(url) instead
 * added GM_xmlhttpRequest for FF users ; remove use of unsafeWindow :) ; use of JSON.parse if supported
 * added try-catch block

 * Still don't understand why it's not working with 'Twitter Sidebar Replies', processRequest is called, and modify DOM ! But no repercusion on the screen, W.T.F. ?
 * tweetbe.at is working with Opera, not with Firefox, why ? +really slow with FF

*1.3*:
 * added option storedRequests
 * reduce number of requests by storing results
 * Tried to make the script work with 'Twitter Sidebar Replies' userscript - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/36635 -> Concerning !GreaseMonkey user only, because this script doesn't work with Opera. But somehow firefox refuse to create the network request after script injection : with firebug check html->head->scripts... Those scripts which stay indicate 'Failed to load source for'. Really weird = clic edit, add a character and remove it rapidly, clic edit(stop) -> ff load the script and execute it perfectly, url is replaced ! WTF ?! (first comment line 145 to avoid js error)

*1.2*:
 * added ajax support :) - Examples : 'more' button on twitter, tweetbe.at, twitter100.com, ...
 * added option : showPopup
 * added option : forceVisibleHref
 * reduce 'Media type' font size in the tooltip
 * exclude http://longurl.org/*
 * exclude the userscript.org tutorial itself ^^

 * reduce alpha transparency of the popup

 * Initial release
