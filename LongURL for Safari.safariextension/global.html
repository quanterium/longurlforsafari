<!--
By default, this script replace the href="" attribute of the link with the long url.
->This means your browser won't call the url shortener website when you'll click the link.
This is voluntary, because thoses services are useless and dangerous : obfuscation act like a third DNS resolver.
See : http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001276.html
By default this script also replace the content of the a tag (visible text) with the title of the page.

I think the expand function - as seen in twitter search results for instance - is boring and useless for the user.
Plus there's the security problem with the shortened links.
Several possibilities :
-Call the API each time needed (onmouseover) ; but user have to wait & can rapidly click (before xhr return the long-url)
-Request at page load if there is a/some link(s) in the page, in order to process tiny url
  -In that case don't forget to take car of new data (ajax)
=> My script is using the second possibility.

------------------
TODO:

2.1:

1.4:
- Migration from Google Code to GitHub

1.3:
- Changed additional services list to be obtained from the extension web site rather
  than having it built in, so changes can be made without requiring an extension upgrade
- Removed some debugging log messages

1.2.3:
- Additions to additional services list

1.2.2:
- Additions to additional services list

1.2.1:
- Modifications to additional services list

CHANGELOG from Google Chrome version:

1.7 : [only for Google Chrome]
-Added localStorage to preserve settings when the browser is closed

1.6 : [only for Google Chrome]
-Chrome extension version
-zIndex & wordWrap style for tooltip

1.5 :
-Prevent memory leak, see http://ajaxian.com/archives/dynamic-script-generation-and-memory-leaks

1.4 :
-optimize showTooltip function -> 10x faster with ff \o/ (mouse over -> tooltip time to appear)
-remove processRequest & showTooltip useless parameter (json), using LongURL.storedRequests[url] instead
-added GM_xmlhttpRequest for FF users ; remove use of unsafeWindow :) ; use of JSON.parse if supported
-added try-catch block

-Still don't understand why it's not working with 'Twitter Sidebar Replies', processRequest is called, and modify DOM ! But no repercusion on the screen, W.T.F. ?
-tweetbe.at is working with Opera, not with Firefox, why ? +really slow with FF

1.3 :
-added option storedRequests
-reduce number of requests by storing results
-Tried to make the script work with 'Twitter Sidebar Replies' userscript - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/36635
-> Concerning GreaseMonkey user only, because this script doesn't work with Opera.
But somehow firefox refuse to create the network request after script injection : with firebug check html->head->scripts...
Thoses scripts which stay indicate 'Failed to load source for'. Really weird = clic edit, add a character and remove it rapidly, clic edit(stop) -> ff load the script and execute it perfectly, url is replaced ! WTF ?! (first comment line 145 to avoid js error)

1.2 :
-added ajax support :) - Examples : 'more' button on twitter, tweetbe.at, twitter100.com, ...
-added option : showPopup
-added option : forceVisibleHref
-reduce 'Media type' font size in the tooltip
-exclude http://longurl.org/*
-exclude the userscript.org tutorial itself ^^

-reduce alpha transparency of the popup
